# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based disease prediction system implemented using Python. The project uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset to predict potential diseases based on user input.

---

## Project Description

This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms entered by the user. The user-friendly interface is created using the Tkinter library, and the machine learning model is trained using a dataset of symptoms and diseases (in CSV format). The system provides probable disease predictions based on the input symptoms, helping in early detection and healthcare guidance.

Key features include:
- **Tkinter GUI** for an intuitive interface.
- **Machine learning model** trained to predict diseases based on symptoms.
- **CSV dataset** containing symptom-disease mappings.

## Files Included

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the code for training the machine learning model and building the disease prediction system.
- **Dataset (CSV)**: A CSV file containing the dataset used for training the model (symptoms and associated diseases).
- **Tkinter GUI**: Code for building the graphical user interface to interact with the disease prediction system.

## Installation

 If you donâ€™t have Python installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
You can download Anaconda, which comes with Jupyter pre-installed, from the following [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution/).

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SPPramod/Disease-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Disease-Prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install tkinter
    ```

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook to view and run the machine learning model code:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance on the dataset.
2. Use the Tkinter-based graphical user interface to input symptoms and receive disease predictions.
3. Analyze the results and adjust the model or dataset as needed to improve prediction accuracy.
